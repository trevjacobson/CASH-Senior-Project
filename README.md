## Overview

Senior Design Project for CS 472 at UNLV. This project is a Custom Autonomous Secure Home (CASH) in which the hardware and website hosting are running on a Raspberry Pi 3. 

## Hardware

The hardware is all connected through a Raspberry Pi 3. The home devices include a 1080p wifi webcam, 3 led lights, a weather sensor for indoor temp, pressure, and humidity, and a fan to simulate AC/Heating.

## Website
